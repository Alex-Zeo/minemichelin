Mining the Michelin awards for the restaurant data. 
We want to evaluate the performance of Atlanta's first year on the Michelin list compared to other cities.

At first glance it looks like Atlanta underperfomed its first year on the Michelin list. However, a fair comparison must consider when cities joined the Michelin list: New York (2005),  Chicago (2011), San Francisco (2007), Los Angeles (2008)

In this context Atlanta is doing well:
- 306 NY Michelin Restaurants / 18 years = 17 awards per year
- 166 Chicago Michelin Restaurants / 13 years = 12.7 awards per year
- 111 SF Michelin Restaurants / 17 years = 6.5 awards per year

- 40 Atlanta Michelin Restaurants / 1 year = 40 awards per year
